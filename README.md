# Seedling

Seedling is an app built to help gardeners plan their gardens, keep track of seeds and grow methods, and share that knowledge with their gardener pals. 

I have a veggie garden every year, and the process of planning out the beds, researching, and ordering seeds is a total mood-booster through the winter months! I built this app to start keeping a record of seed varieties I love, crop placement for better crop rotation, and grow methods that work well for me.
